              Our privacy policy is very simple. Your images are yours. You own
              them. When you upload images to ImageResizer.com, we temporarily
              save them on our servers to process them and they are deleted
              automatically from our servers after 24 hrs - forever. We
              don&apos;t ask you for any other private information. If you
              choose to post the resized images to Facebook directly from
              ImageResizer.com, and give us permission by connecting through
              Facebook, then we get your email id from Facebook and we store it
              in our database to keep a track of how many users are making use
              of the feature. Your email is not shared with anyone. If we ever
              send you an email, it will come with an unsubscribe link so you
              can remove yourself form our list.
